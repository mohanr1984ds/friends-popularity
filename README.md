# Could Chandler Bing be any more popular?

There is always a debate among the Friends serial fans who among the lead six actors is the most likable character. For the final project I am going to investigate which character out of the six main characters in Friends series is famous among twitter users. Most of the poll outcomes find Chandler to be the most famous character and I intend to find whether the same opinion is true among twitter users even now. This type of analysis has a wide set of audience from Ad companies to fashion industries. They can benefit from understanding which character resonates well with the public and utilize that knowledge in ad campaigns or in designing fashion apparel/merchandise based out of that character.
